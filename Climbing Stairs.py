# Climbing Stairs
# You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2
        a, b = 1, 2

        # Fibonacci
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
